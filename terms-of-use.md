## Personal Information

When you voluntarily submit identifiable data on this website (this includes submission of feedback form, questionnaires etc.), the information submitted is used solely to respond to your queries and for its intended purpose. We do not share web user information with third parties.

## Virus Protection

We make every effort to check and test material for viruses. However, it is recommended that you run an anti-virus program on all materials downloaded from the internet.

## External Websites

NHS Wales is not responsible for the content or reliability of any linked websites. We accept no liability in respect of the content or for the consequences of following any advice included on such sites. Listing should not be taken as an endorsement of any kind.

We cannot guarantee that these links will work all of the time and have no control over the availability of the linked pages or change of website address.

NHS Wales reserves the right to reject or remove links to any website.

## Google Translate Feature

NHS Wales websites, which have the Google Translate Feature enabled, offer translations performed by Googleâ„¢ Translate, a third party service that NHS Wales has no control over. Translated pages are not part of the hosted website, nor have any link to the NHS Wales domain.

This service is an automated computer translation and, as such, will not be a perfect translation and will be prone to mistakes that a human speaker would not otherwise make.

The translation should be used as a rough guide only. NHS Wales in no way accepts liability for the accuracy of these translations or any loss incurred as a result of them.

## Future Amendments

Subsequent changes to these terms will be made available on this website.
